<h2>What is Elastic Security SIEM</h2>

Elastic Security SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a powerful solution within the Elastic Stack designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security threats in real time. This is the SIEM that we will be using to ingest data, develop alerts, and detect threats.

The first step to setting up our environment is to install Oracle VirtualBox, the hypervisor we will use to create our virtual machines. To install VirtualBox, visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and download the installer specific to your operating system. After the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Once the installation is finished, launch the VirtualBox application
