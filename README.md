<h2>What is Elastic Security SIEM</h2>

Elastic Security SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a powerful solution within the Elastic Stack designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security threats in real time. This is the SIEM that we will be using to ingest data, develop alerts, and detect threats.
