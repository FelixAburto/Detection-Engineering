<h2>What is Elastic Security SIEM</h2>

Elastic Security SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a powerful solution within the Elastic Stack designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security threats in real time. This SIEM will be used to ingest data, develop alerts, and detect threats.

<h2>Create A Free Trail Elastic Cloud Account</h2>

To get started, visit Elastic.co and sign up for a free 14-day trial of Elastic. This will set up a cloud deployment of the Elastic environment, which we will use to ingest data from our various sources.

Now that we have created our Elastic deployment, we will move on to setting up our environments.

The first step in setting up our environment is to install Oracle VirtualBox, the hypervisor we will use to create our virtual machines. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [VirtualBox Downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
5. After the installation is finished, launch the VirtualBox application.

Now that we have Oracle Virtualbox installed we will move on to creating our virtual machines.
